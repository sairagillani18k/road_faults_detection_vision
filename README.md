**Paving the Way to Safer Roads With Computer Vision**

In our journey through life, roads play an integral role in connecting us to our destinations. But like everything else, they wear out with time. Small road cracks don't pose much danger to human life, but if left unchecked, they create road conditions that can lead to fatal accidents and major financial losses. For authorities, manually inspecting roads for faults is a cumbersome task, hence the need for a computer vision-based solution.

**Eyes That See Beyond the Surface: Fault detection in action**

Imagine if roads could communicate their needs to us. We go a small step in this direction- using advanced computer vision cameras and detection algorithms, we can carefully inspect the road surface for signs of distress and identify faults that might go unnoticed by the human eye. 

Here I show some results I got by training the Yolov8 model with 100 epochs, on open-source data consisting of two classes of road defects: cracks and potholes.
